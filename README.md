## 📖 About the Initiative

**SoCal-AIRE** is a multidisciplinary coalition designed to serve as a dynamic regional forum for knowledge exchange and capacity building. 

We bridge the gap between local innovations and major national resources. By connecting Southern California's research institutions with NSF-supported ecosystems—such as **ACCESS** and the **NAIRR**—we aim to democratize access to advanced computing and AI tools.

### Our Mission
To foster a collaborative environment where AI is integrated seamlessly into research pipelines and educational curricula, championing transparency, reproducibility, and ethical standards.
